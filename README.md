# Jarir Books Scraper and Clustering Project

This project involves scraping book data from **Jarir.com**, analyzing the data, and clustering books based on their features. The project includes deploying the clustering model using **FastAPI** for API access and **Streamlit** for an interactive web application.

## Features

1. **Scraping Book Data**  
   - Collect book information such as title, author, price, category, etc., from Jarir.com.
   
2. **Data Processing**  
   - Clean and preprocess the scraped data.
   - Extract relevant features for clustering.

3. **Clustering Model**  
   - Use clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans, DBSCAN) to group books into meaningful clusters.

4. **Deployment**  
   - **FastAPI**: Expose the clustering model through an API.  
   - **Streamlit**: Create an interactive app to visualize and explore the book clusters.
